### **2.1.3 Interrupt**** Controller**

---

#### 2.1.3.1 Introduction

---

K1 contains

- One Processor Core Local Interrupt Controller (CLINT)
- One Platform Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC)

to manage interrupts for two processor clusters.

The exception handling, which includes exceptions and external interrupts, is an important function of the processor. When specific events occur, the processor redirects to handle them. Such events can include hardware faults, instruction execution errors, user program service requests, and more.

CLINT is a memory address mapped module for handling software interrupts and timer interrupts.

Instead, PLIC samples external interrupt sources, then prioritizes and distributes them accordingly. In the PLIC model, both the machine mode and supervisor mode of each core are valid interrupt targets. PLIC supports up to 256 external interrupt sources. Each interrupt supports both level and edge formats.

### **2.1.4 Debug ****&**** Trace**

---

#### 2.1.4.1 Introduction

---

The debugging interface serves as the channel for software to interact with the processor. Through this interface, users can access CPU registers and memory contents, as well as other on-chip device information. Additionally, tasks such as downloading programs can be performed via the debugging interface.

#### 2.1.4.2 Block Diagram

---

The micro-architecture of the debugging interface is depicted below.

![](static/HFs7bWt8voNeZrxUTmYcbgGynuh.png)

As can be seen, the debugging system consists of

- A debugging software
- A debugging agent service
- A debugger
- A debugging interface

These components are interconnected as follows:

- The debugging software communicates with the debugging agent service over a network
- The debugging agent service connects to the debugger via USB
- The debugger interacts with the CPU through the JTAG interface

The JTAG memory access method could be either _progbuf_ or _sysbus_ mode, where

- The _progbuf_ mode is a standard JTAG method that accesses memory through the CPU
- The _sysbus_ mode bypasses the CPU to access on-chip resources via the System Bus Access (SBA) port

## **2.2 Memory ****&**** Storage        **

### **2.2.1 On-Chip Memory        **

---

#### 2.2.1.1 Introduction

K1 includes the following on-chip memory:

- 128KB boot-ROM
- 256KB SRAM shared between Main CPU and RCPU

### **2.2.2 DDR**

---

#### **2.2.2.1 Introduction**

---

The DDR controller features a cutting-edge design that optimizes DRAM access by rearranging requests into an efficient order, rather than processing them in their original sequence. It uses re-ordering buffers (ROBs) to reorganize accesses to the SRAM device for improving performance, while maintaining the original transaction order for requests with the same ID on the AXI interface.

Additionally, the DDR controller includes a unified write pool to temporarily store write transactions. Such write pool minimizes write latency and reduces the performance penalty due to switching between read and write operation at the DRAM interface. With a built-in heuristic write buffer control and user-programmable write buffer control, the DDR controller dynamically balances read and write operation performance in real-time.

The DDR controller is also designed to support AMBA AXI4 bus protocols. It is fully scalable and supports up to 4 AXI ports.

#### **2.2.2.2 ****Features**

- Support for x16, x32 DRAM devices (1 DQS per 8 DQ)
- Support for up to 2 Chip Select (CS) or Rank per channel
- Support for up to 8 banks per CS for LPDDRx
- Each CS can be mapped to a different starting address
- Each CS can be programmed for 8MB to 16GB
- DRAM banks can be kept open after access (no auto-pre-charge)
- Support for burst length of 8 and 16 for the applicable DDR type
- Programmable address order
- Flexible bank placement between CS and data width
- Implementation of memory controller performance counters
- Global monitors for RISC-V exclusive load/store access

##### 2.3.4.3.4 CSC

---

Support for Color Space Conversion (CSC) as per formats below:

- BT601 and BT709: conversion between narrow and full range
- RGB to YUV
- YUV to RGB

The conversion process transforms input channels into output channels by using a transformation matrix with clamping in order to ensure valid output values, i.e. within the range [0, 255].

For that purpose, the formulas below are implemented, and the details of the specific variables and registers involved are tabled immediately after.

**[Firstly for c****omputing the intermediate**** channel ****values****]**

$$
C0_{inter} = (Layer\_matrix[0][0]*C0_{in} + Layer\_matrix[0][1]*C1_{in} + Layer\_matrix[0][2]*C2_{in} + 512)>>(10+Layer\_matrix[0][3])
$$

$$
C1_{inter} = (Layer\_matrix[1][0]*C0_{in} + Layer\_matrix[1][1]*C1_{in} + Layer\_matrix[1][2]*C2_{in} + 512)>>(10+Layer\_matrix[1][3])
$$

$$
C2_{inter} = (Layer\_matrix[2][0]*C0_{in} + Layer\_matrix[2][1]*C1_{in} + Layer\_matrix[2][2]*C2_{in} + 512)>>(10+Layer\_matrix[2][3])
$$

**[****Then**** for ****clamping ****in order to ****ensure ****valid output values]**

$$
C0_{out}=clamp(C0_{inter},0,255)
$$

$$
C1_{out}=clamp(C1_{inter},0,255)
$$

$$
C2_{out}=clamp(C2_{inter},0,255)
$$

$$
C3_{out}=clamp(C3_{in},0,255)
$$

##### 2.3.4.3.5 Scaling

---

The scaling operation follows a systematic superblock-based approach, where

- The first four superblocks are outputted horizontally then vertically
- After the vertical output is completed, the process restarts from the first row of superblocks

##### 2.3.4.3.6 Storing

---

A 16×16 image block can be stored in DDR memory, however only the portion that falls within the output crop region is stored which is converted to the specified output color format, such as YUV, RGB, etc.

The code for storing an image block is listed below, and the details of the specific variables and registers involved are tabled immediately after.

## **2.4 Video Subsystem    **

### 2.4.1 Introduction

---

The Video Processing Unit (VPU) is a video accelerator engine with two cores designed for decoding and encoding multiple video standards. It includes a host CPU to run firmware to control the hardware engine of functions, such as bit stream parsing, control of video hardware sub-blocks and error resilience.

The VPU can work at up to 819MHz clock frequency, and supports a wide range of video standards, including H.265, H.264, VP8, VP9, MPEG4, MPEG2 and H263. It supports simultaneous

- Encoding and decoding at 1080P@60fps
- H264/H265 encoding at 1080P@30fps and H264/H265 decoding at 4K@30fps

The video codec core block executes the actual decoding and encoding for each standard by using hardwired logic. Among them, Macroblock Sequencer is the main controller that schedules process flows of the sub-blocks, and aims to reduce loads on the processor and complexity of the firmware.

As mentioned, several standard-independent blocks share common logics while they are in operation in order to ensure efficiency and streamlined performance.

![](static/Z4eZbNJpjoPDtJxb5FWcUavtn6f.png)

It is clearly understandable how the display data are efficiently processed, then converted into SPI-compatible signals, then transmitted to the connected LCD display.

#### **2.5.4.4 Functions**

---

##### **2.5.4.****4.1**** Blending Function**

---

The blending function of the DSI controller is used to combine multiple layers of images or overlays with different levels of transparency (alpha values).

An example of layers and their respective alpha values is depicted below, where

- **L0**: Bottom layer, base image
- **L1**: Middle layer, alpha value **a****1**
- **L2**: Top layer, alpha value **a****2**

![](static/GAqWbhdhsoCZDIxE7eqcBxsxnwh.png)

The following blending modes are supported:

- Normal Alpha Blending Mode
- Pre-Multiple Alpha Blending Mode
- Special Alpha Blending Mode

In the code, a different formula is implemented for each blending mode that uses the alpha value **a1** as per the following conditions:

```c
if (L1 == color_key)
a1 = 8’h0;
else if (layer_alpha_sel == 1)
a1 = layer_alpha;
else
a1 = pixel_alpha;
```

Details for each blending mode are explained in the following subsections.

###### 2.5.4.4.1.1 **Normal Alpha Blending Mode**

---

With reference to the example figure shown above,

- For **2 layers**, the formula implemented is

  - $$
    L'=L1×a1+L0×(1-a1)
    $$
- For **3 ****layers** (<u>not recommended</u>), the formula implemented is

  - $$
    L'=L2×a2+L1×a1×(1-a2)+L0×(1-a1)×(1-a2)
    $$

  > **Not****e.** Alpha value is not supported for write-back in this case
  >

In the code, the pixel value **L'** depends on the alpha value **a1** as per the following conditions:

```c
if (a1 == 8’hFF)
L' = L1;
else if (a1 == 8’h00)
L' = L0;
else
L' = (L1-L0) × a1/256 + L0
```

###### 2.5.4.4.1.2 **Pre-Multiple Alpha Blending**** Mode**

---

With reference to the example figure shown above,

- For **2 layers**, the formula implemented is

  - $$
    L'=L1+L0×(1−a1)
    $$
- For **3 layers** (<u>not recommended</u>), the formula implemented is

  - $$
    L'=L2+L1×(1−a2)+L0×(1−a1)×(1−a2)
    $$

  > **Note.** Alpha value is supported for write-back and its value is given by the formula $a'=a1+a2−a1×a2$
  >

In the code, the pixel value **L'** depends on the alpha value **a1** as per the following conditions:

```c
if (a1 == 8’hFF)
L' = L1;
else if (a1 == 8’h00)
L' = L0;
else
L' = L1-L0 × (1-a1)/256;
```

###### 2.5.4.4.1.3 **Special Alpha Blending**** Mode**

---

With reference to the example figure shown above,

- For **2 layers**, the formula implemented is

  - $$
    L'=L1+L0×a1
    $$
- For **3 layers** (<u>not recommended</u>), the formula implemented is

  - $$
    L'=L2+L1×a2+L0×a1×a2
    $$

  > **Note****. **Alpha value is not supported for write-back in this case
  >

In the code, the pixel value **L'** depends on the alpha value **a1** as per the following conditions:

```c
if (a1 == 8’hFF)
L' = L0;
else
L' = L1 + L0 × a1/256;
```

##### **2.5.4.****4.2**** Dither Function**

---

The process of the Dither function is depicted below.

![](static/A8c3bW4O2oG0ndxoU5mc8TsOnJc.png)

The Dither function can be enabled/disabled by software.

##### **2.5.4.****4.3**** Fmark Function**

---

The Fmark function controls the start of displaying output. In particular,

- If Fmark function is **enabled**, displaying output will wait until the Fmark signal is received
- If Fmark function is **disabled**, displaying output will start immediately after initiated by software

By software is possible to enable/disable Fmark function as well as control the polarity of the Fmark signal.

It is recommended to have a register to set how long displaying output is delayed after LCDC received the Fmark signal.

##### **2.5.4.****4.4**** Background Color Display**** Function**

---

When no layer is enabled, a background color can be displayed without fetching data from DDR. The background color can be configured by software.

##### **2.5.4.****4.5** **Image ****Cap****t****ure Function**

---

To apply the image capture function, the following parameters should be configured by software firstly:

- **s****tartx** = X coordinate of the start point of the capture
- **s****tarty** = Y coordinate of the start point of the capture
- **w****idth** = Width (in pixels) of the capture from (X,Y) start point
- **h****eight** = Height (in pixels) of the capture from (X, Y) start point
- **base\_addr** = Memory start address for storing the capture
- **pitch** = Distance (in bytes) between the start of two consecutive rows of pixels stored in the memory, including any padding for alignment or hardware requirements

The process of the image capture function is depicted below.

A dedicated I2C module, referred to as the power I2C module, is used to interface to the power management IC.

The I2C bus interface can function as both a master and a slave device on the I2C bus. This serial bus, developed by Philips Corporation, uses a 2-pin interface as follows:

- **SDA**: Data pin for input and output functions
- **SCL**: Clock pin for timing reference and control of the I2C bus

The I2C bus allows the I2C unit to interface with other I2C peripherals and microcontrollers. It requires minimal hardware, providing an economical solution for communicating status and control information between chips and external devices.

The I2C bus interface is a peripheral device residing on the peripheral bus that performs

- **Data ****t****ransfer**, handled through a buffered interface for reliable communication
- **Control ****and s****tatus ****m****anagement**, accessed via memory-mapped registers

The One-Wire Bus Master Interface Controller is responsible for receiving and transmitting data on the One-Wire bus. It fully controls the One-Wire bus using 8-bit commands. The processor interacts with the controller by loading commands, reading and writing data, and configuring interrupt controls through 5 specific registers.

All One-Wire bus timing and control are generated within the One-Wire Bus Master Interface Controller once a command or data is loaded by the host. When there is activity on the bus that requires the CPU to respond, the One-Wire Bus Master Interface Controller sets a status bit and, if enabled, sends an interrupt to the CPU.

For detailed information about specific slave implementations, please refer to the **Book of iButton® Standard****s **which describes the operation of the One-Wire bus master interface.

Peripheral devices do not directly supply addresses or commands to the memory controller. Each DMA request from a peripheral triggers a memory-bus transaction. The processor can directly access the peripheral bus by using the DMA controller which acts as a DMA bridge to bypass the DMA of the system

The DMA controller can manage different data transfer types in DMA Flow-Through Mode through 16 configurable DMA channels as tabled below.

## **2.13 Power Management Unit**

### 2.13.1 Introduction

---

A two-level power management strategy is implemented to control various granularities of power consumption. Different power domains and power states are also defined to achieve ultra-low power consumption.

A total of 9 power domains are implemented, and they are for

- CPU cores

  > **Note.** Each CPU core has its own power domain independently controlled
  >
- CPU clusters

  > **Note.** Each CPU cluster has its own power domain independently controlled
  >
- Video Encoder/Decoder
- GPU
- HDMI Display Subsystem
- MIPI DSI Subsystem
- Video Input Subsystem
- RCPU (including N308, Audio Codec, RCPU Peripherals)
- Always-On-Domain (AON)

All those power domains, except AON, can be powered off depending on specific application scenarios.

In order to achieve the minimal power consumption, different power states are designed as tabled below:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>No.</strong></td>
<td><strong>Power State Name</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>ACTIVE </td>
<td>The system is alive and active, with all power domains on, except those power domains with power switches that can be turned off selectively and independently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>CORE-IDLE</td>
<td>Each core stops executing instructions and enters an idle state, with clock gating automatically after a Wait-for-Interrupt (WFI) execution. The core exits this state  when receiving an interrupt routed to it and continues execution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Core-Power-Off</td>
<td>Each core, when voted, enters a power-off state after Core-Idle sleep mode. The core exits this state when receiving an interrupt, with power turned on and reset released.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>CPU-Cluster-Power-Off<br/></td>
<td>Each CPU cluster, when voted, enters this low-power state after all cores within this cluster have entered the Core-Power-Off state, with L2/TCM memory also shut down. <br/>Any active interrupt routing to CPU cores in this cluster would bring CPU cluster out of this state, then power on, clock resume and reset release.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Home-Screen</td>
<td>The main bus fabric AXI clock is gated off (if voted) after both CPU clusters enter CPU-Cluster-Power-Off mode.<br/>Any interrupt will wake up the chip from this state by resuming the main bus AXI clock, and powering up the corresponding CPU cluster and CPU core to which the interrupt is routed, resuming the CPU clock, and releasing the reset to service the interrupt routine. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>Chip-Sleep</td>
<td>This is the most ultra-low power state, with all PLLs/Power islands off. Only 32K RTC clock remains alive, and the 24M VCXO can be configured to be on or off. <br/>In this state only the logic/IO in AON domain alives, and a pin named SLEEP_OUT connected to PMIC would be deasserted to signal PMIC to lower the VCC power supply voltage to reduce lower power comsumption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>RCPU with SOC LP</td>
<td>RCPU power domain is an independent power island and can function in any of above PMU states. RCPU can vote for different SoC low-power states according to its specific scenario requirements. <br/>The RCPU itself has four low-power states as follows: <br/>- Active Mode: Clock running<br/>- ClkGate Mode: Clock gating <br/>- PLL Off Mode: PLL powered off<br/>- Power Off Mode: RCPU power is shut down, but the RCPU AON domain remains alive</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

> **Note.** VPU, GPU, ISP, DPU power islands can be turned on or off by software, and are independent of the power states **No. 1~5** in the table above

In the **Chip-Sleep low power state** (see **No. 6** in the table above), the following interrupts or events can wake up the chip:

- Pad edge detection
- Keypad press
- RTC/Timer/WDT
- USB/RCPU/AP2AUDIO\_IPC
- SD/EMMC/PCIE
- PMIC

In the **RCPU power off state **(see **No. 7** in the table above), the following interrupts or events can wake up RCPU PMU to resume its power supply:

- Audio plug interrupt / Hook key interrupt / Class-G short power interrupt / Audio OCP interrupt
- AP IPC power-on request
- RCPU AON Timer wakeup request
- Sensor-Hub GPIO wakeup request
